Thread::Const - Constant strings efficiently shared between threads

=head1 VERSION

    use Thread::Const;

    const(my $foo = 'some very large string');
    const my $bar, 'some other very large string';

This module generates constant values that can be shared among threads. This may reduce memory usage because the variable won't be copied.

This module defined one function, which it exports by default.

Make $string a constant that will be shared between threads. If $value is defined it will be assigned to $string.
